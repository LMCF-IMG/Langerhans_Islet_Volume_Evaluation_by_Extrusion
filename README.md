# Langerhans_Islet_Volume_Evaluation_by_Extrusion

**Macro for [ImageJ/Fiji](https://fiji.sc/).**

## Overview

The macro uses the concept of [**"spherical extrusion"**](https://github.com/jiri-janacek/biomat) to evaluate the volumes of Langerhans islets from their 2D microscopic image projections from a wide-field microscope, developed by [**Dr. Jiří Janáček**](https://github.com/jiri-janacek), [Laboratory of advanced microscopy and data analyses, Institute of Physiology of the Czech Academy of Sciences, Prague, Czech Republic](https://fgu.cas.cz/en/research-and-laboratories/service-departments/laboratory-of-advanced-microscopy-and-data-analyses/):
